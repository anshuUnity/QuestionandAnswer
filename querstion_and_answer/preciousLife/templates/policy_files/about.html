                    <h6><b>Dear Visitor, </b></h6>
                    <p>Welcome to our forum. It’s with utmost gratitude, we state that it’s our humble endeavor to provide a platform to the vox-pop. We would like to distinguish ourselves, however. The sole motto behind the inception of this platform is to let you ask those questions of your lives, share those events and educate the fellow readers about those instances that have so far been unheard, unanswered and sheathed deep inside the unexplored nooks of your heart.</p>
                    <p>To give you a context, as per the <b>WHO</b> statistics on Suicide, close to <b>800,000</b> people die committing suicide every year, which is one person, every <b>40 second</b>. Imagine, how cheap life has become! What drives a person to eventually take such a gut-wrenching decision of ending the life? A life so full of potentials, dreams and what not! It’s a question that dies with them.</p>
                    <p>However, as they say you only live once! So, why keep things buried in your hearts? There is so much more to this world than just pain and sufferings. You only have to open yourselves to the boundless opportunities. Let us help you in this regard. Dear reader, if you have any question that you’ve feared to share with your family, friends or kiths-and-kins, come to us and ask them, share them. You know, it’s better late, than never! Any thought that has been troubling you, traumatizing you or tormenting you and leading your thoughts towards unthinkable consequences, take a pause! And come to us. Who knows? If this turns out be the best decision of your life!</p>
